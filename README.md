## Local Development

To host and test the site locally, follow these steps:

1. **Install Node.js & npm** if you haven't already. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).
2. **Clone the repository** and navigate to the project folder.
3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. **Start the development server**:
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```
5. **Open localhost**: By default, Vite will start the server. Check your terminal output (usually `http://localhost:8080`) and open this URL in your browser to view the application.

## Building for Production

To create a production build, run:
```sh
npm run build
```
This will generate optimized static assets in the `dist` directory, which you can host on any static site provider.
